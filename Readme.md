#HomeKit Tester

HomeKitTester is an iOS App to test and benchmark the behavior of HomeKit Accessory Protocol impementation using single connection. (Sorry, for more connection, JB is needed)

It makes use HomeKit Framework on iOS, and currently cover IP based connection. (BLE require changes from testing Bonjour to BLE. However, I'm not working on BLE version of PHK)

This is not based on the MFi Documentation on HomeKit Test Case (still, I don't have access here, and possibly won't for a long time :P ), but the test case would be based on the knowledge from the PersonalHomeKit project, and can be extend to the MFi standard. 

Technology used: Core Data, HomeKit, iOS SDK, Swift

Tested: iOS 10.2

License: You can use it for personal usage as hobbyist. However, for business purpose (even if for free), please contact me directly. (Unless you need to repurpose the code, or release it, I can allow you to do that in 5 minutes) You can find me on Linkedin, Twitter, etc.
